    """The Electrophys Feature Extract Library (eFEL) allows 
    neuroscientists to automatically extract features from time series data 
    recorded from neurons (both in vitro and in silico).
    Examples are the action potential width and amplitude in 
    voltage traces recorded during whole-cell patch clamp experiments.
    The user of the library provides a set of traces and selects the 
    features to be calculated. The library will then extract the requested 
    features and return the values to the user."""
